# Team Generator

  ## Description  

  This project showcases a CLI that generates a simple team directory based on user input and dynamically creates an html file to display the team information. View the Screencastify walkthrough video [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JYJbzurSLy42A82Q3bs_kZFhQKv0cPZq/view)

  ## Installation
  Clone the repository to your local machine and run 'npm install' to add the necessary modules.

  ### Usage
  After sucessful installation, open the folder with a code editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended) and in the terminal, run 'node app.js' to begin the application.
  
  A series of prompts will collect data that will be used to generate the team.html file, which can then be viewed in the user's browser. 
  
  I had some challenges when it came to testing the application and was not able to get all of the tests to pass successfully. Hopefully, further troubleshooting will allow me to debug the app in the future.
